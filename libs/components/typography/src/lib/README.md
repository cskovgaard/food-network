# Typography

The typography component is responsible for displaying text according to our style guidelines.

It has some predefined font variants, but it is possible to overwrite some of the properties of
these variants when implementing the component.

## Using the component

Import the component:

```typescript
import Typography from '@food/components/typography';
```

Then you can use the component like this:

```tsx
<Typography variant="h1" fontWeight="regular">
  Text
</Typography>
```
